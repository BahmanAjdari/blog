R is great because of not only it has a huge power inside its heart, but also it has a nice community in its ecosystem that helps individuals to learn and improve. One the greatest communities is #TidyTuesday. If you follow this hashtag on Twitter you will see lots of tweets about data visualization and more that you can learn from them.

[TidyTuesday's Github page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is the landing page of the community. You will find out a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. The emphasis of the projects are placed on underestanding how to summarize and arrange data to build meaningful charts and data insights. You are welcome to join for free.

The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. While we understand that the two are related, the focus of this practice is purely on building skills with real-world data.
